 Sudoku Game - Build Instructions
=======================

Requirements:
-------------
- CMake version 3.10 or higher
- C++ Compiler:
    - Either MinGW (for mingw32-make)
    - Or Visual Studio with Desktop C++ Development tools

Build Steps:
------------

1. Open PowerShell (Windows) or Terminal (Linux/macOS).

2. Navigate to the project directory where your CMakeLists.txt file is located:

   Example (PowerShell):
   cd C:\Users\Malak\Desktop\sudoku

3. Create a build directory and run CMake:

   Windows (Using Visual Studio Compiler):
   ---------------------------------------
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .

   Windows (Using MinGW - if installed):
   -------------------------------------
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   mingw32-make

   Linux / macOS:
   --------------
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

4. Running the program:

   After a successful build, the executable will be located in:

   - On Windows (Visual Studio build):
     C:\Users\Malak\Desktop\sudoku\build\Debug\sudoku.exe

     Run it like this from PowerShell:

     cd build\Debug
     .\sudoku.exe

   - On Windows (MinGW build):
     cd build\Debug
     .\sudoku.exe

   - On Linux/macOS:
     ./sudoku

Note:
-----
- Make sure CMake and your compiler are installed and added to your system PATH.
- If you modify any .cpp or .hpp files, re-run the build steps.
